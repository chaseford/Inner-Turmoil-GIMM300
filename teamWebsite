			<h3>All About Me</h3>
			<h4>I was born and raised in Boise, Idaho and have been involved with games and interactive media for as long as I remember. I think we as a society are generally unaware of how fast developing technologies affect our psychology. As someone who wants to work in video games and interactive experiences in the future, I feel understanding how people are affected by technology is integral to understanding the morality of development in that space. In this course I hope to gain both the knowledge and sense to responsibly use the best tools available in web development. I also hope to find insight into how best to personally react to the rapid changes in technology around me.</h4>
