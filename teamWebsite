			<h3>All About Me</h3>
			<h4>I was born and raised in Santa Clarita, CA and transferred to Boise State after a year and a half at my local Community College. I attended Boise State in order to join the GIMM program, because technology has always been a passion of mine, and I see very big growth in this field in the near the future. Growing up, I played sports all my life, and I love to be in the outdoors. I ride motorcycles, mountain bikes, I snowboard, surf, and skate. Boise has treated me extremely well so far, and I am excited to see where the future takes me. I am very excited in taking this Mobile Web Development course and having the opportunity to creative an interactive mobile application. I have yet to decide a specific field I want to go into after I graduate, but I want to use both my programming skills, and creative mindset to make an impact in our society</h4>
